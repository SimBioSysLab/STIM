# Overview
This package contains an algorithm and pipeline for multiplicity of infection (MOI) and haplotype detection of P. falciporum malaria from 24-SNP barcode-based multiplex-PCR NGS assays. The algorithm is based on the StrainPycon (https://www.ymsir.com/strainpycon/) package for malarial strain disambiguation.
